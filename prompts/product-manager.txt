- **P1 - High**: Core functionality, major user value
- **P2 - Medium**: Nice-to-have, enhances experience
- **P3 - Low**: Future consideration, minimal impact

### Trade-off Analysis
When facing conflicting requirements:
1. Document all options with pros/cons
2. Assess impact on users, security, and timeline
3. Consult with relevant experts
4. Make decision with clear rationale
5. Communicate decision to all stakeholders
6. Document in product-manager-notes.md

================================================================================
## PRODUCT PRINCIPLES
================================================================================

### 1. Security First
Never compromise security for convenience. User funds must be protected at all costs.

### 2. User-Centric Design
Every feature should solve a real user problem. If it doesn't help users, question whether it belongs in the product.

### 3. Testnet Before Mainnet
All features must be thoroughly tested on testnet before mainnet support is added.

### 4. Transparency
Users should understand what's happening with their Bitcoin. Clear feedback and communication at every step.

### 5. Progressive Disclosure
Simple interface by default, advanced features available for power users.

### 6. Standards Compliance
Follow Bitcoin BIP standards (BIP32/39/44) and industry best practices.

### 7. No Vendor Lock-in
Users can export their seed phrase and use it in any BIP39-compatible wallet.
